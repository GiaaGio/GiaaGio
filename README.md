My main focus is on UX/UI design, where I love blending creativity, usability, and aesthetics to deliver meaningful interfaces.

🌟 Areas of Interest:

🌱 Currently learning:

Figma & Design Systems to enhance UI design workflows

🤝 I’m open to collaborating on projects that allow me to explore new design ideas, improve user experiences, and grow as both a designer and developer.
